\subsection{CPPSLOW-VER-00-00: CPP design inspection}
\label{cppslow-ver-00-00}

\subsubsection{Requirements}

DMS-REQ-0059,DMS-REQ-0060,DMS-REQ-0061,DMS-REQ-0062,DMS-REQ-0063,DMS-REQ-0130,DMS-REQ-0132,DMS-REQ-0282,DMS-REQ-0283.

\subsubsection{Test items}

This test will check:

\begin{itemize}

  \item{That the design of the calibration products production pipelines is
  adequate to meet the DM subsystem requirements.}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Intercase dependencies}

None.

\subsubsection{Procedure}

By reference to \citeds{LDM-151}, the Science Pipelines design document, and
\citeds{LSE-61}, the DM subsystem requirements, demonstrate that:

\begin{itemize}

  \item{The calibration products to be produced by the design outlined in
  \citeds{LDM-151} satisfy all of the DM requirements;}
  \item{All of the calibration products to be produced are required for use by
  either the L1 or L2 science payloads, or have some other identified
  purpose.}

\end{itemize}
