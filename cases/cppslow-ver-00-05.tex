\subsection{\textsc{cppslow-ver-00-05}: CPP code inspection}
\label{cppslow-ver-00-05}

\subsubsection{Requirements}

DMS-REQ-0132,DMS-REQ-0158,DMS-REQ-0308.

\subsubsection{Test items}

This test will check:

\begin{itemize}

  \item{That the code delivered complies with relevant DM software quality
  standards;}

  \item{That the code is accompanied by appropriate documentation;}

  \item{That the code makes use of appropriate DM interfaces to the rest of
  the system where applicable;}

  \item{That the code is appropriately tested.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Intercase dependencies}

None.

\subsubsection{Procedure}

\begin{itemize}

  \item{Check for the existence of a suite of unit test cases accompanying the
  codebase;}

  \item{Check the code to demonstrate that it is written in the standard LSST
  task framework and that it uses only standardized DM interfaces to logging
  and data access (i.e. it does not print directly to screen or perform
  filesystem I/O within the algorithmic code);}

  \item{Check that the code is accompanied by a user manual describing
  procedures for its installation and operation.}

\end{itemize}
