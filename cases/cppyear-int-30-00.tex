\subsection{CPPYEAR-INT-30-00: Annual Calibration Products Production Service}
\label{cppyear-int-30-00}

\subsubsection{Requirements}

DMS-REQ-0059,DMS-REQ-0060,DMS-REQ-0061,DMS-REQ-0062,DMS-REQ-0063,DMS-REQ-0130,DMS-REQ-0132,DMS-REQ-0265,DMS-REQ-0282,DMS-REQ-0283,DMS-REQ-0289,DMS-REQ-0294,DMS-REQ-0314,DMS-REQ-0346.

\subsubsection{Test items}

This test will check:

\begin{itemize}

  \item{That a service is available which is capable of performing the annual
  calibration products update.}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Intercase dependencies}

\begin{note}
  Also dependent on various pieces of compute middleware and the hardware
  system, for which test cases have not yet been written.
\end{note}

\begin{itemize}
  \item[cppslow-int-20-10][CPPSLOW-INT-20-10]
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Input specification}

The same input is required as for
\hyperref[cppslow-int-20-10]{CPPSLOW-INT-20-10}, with the additional caveat
that a full year's worth of (possibly simulated) input data must be available
for processing.

\subsubsection{Output specification}

As for \hyperref[cppslow-int-20-05]{CPPSLOW-INT-20-10}.

\subsubsection{Procedure}

As for \hyperref[cppslow-int-20-05]{CPPSLOW-INT-20-10}.
