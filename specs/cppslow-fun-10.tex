\subsection{CPPSLOW-FUN-10: Periodic Calibration Product Production Data Products}
\label{cppslow-fun-10}

\subsubsection{Objective}

This test design verifies the existence of algorithms for generating of all
periodic calibration products required by the \citeds[DM System
Requirements]{LSE-61}. These include:

\begin{itemize}

  \item{Bad pixel maps;}
  \item{Bias residual images;}
  \item{Crosstalk correction matrices;}
  \item{Illumination correction frames;}
  \item{Monochromatic flat fields;}
  \item{Dark current correction frames;}
  \item{Fringe correction frames.}

\end{itemize}

Note that the tests described in this section apply to all perioically
executed calibration products production payloads, regardless of cadence (the
same codebase will be used for daily updates and annual calibration products
production).

These tests demonstrate the existence of functional algorithms which calculate
the required products; they are not intended to demonstrate the operation of
an integrated calibration products production system.

\subsubsection{Approach refinements}

The general approach defined in \citeds{LDM-503} is used.

The primary test method is to execute the relevant pipeline tasks on some
sample input dataset and to demonstrate that an appropriate output dataset is
produced.
