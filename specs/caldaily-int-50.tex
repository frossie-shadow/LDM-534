\subsection{CALDAILY-INT-50: Daily Calibration Product Production System}
\label{caldaily-int-50}

\subsubsection{Objective}

The daily calibration product updates provide broadly similar algorithmic
functionality to the periodic updates, and are thus verified by
\hyperref[cppslow-fun-10]{CPPSLOW-FUN-10} and
\hyperref[cppslow-int-20]{CPPSLOW-INT-20}. However, the nature of daily
processing involves some extra constraints:

\begin{itemize}

  \item{The daily update is executed under the control of the Observatory
  Control System (OCS) driven batch processing (rather than the periodic Level
  2 serivce;}

  \item{Both that report and the products themselves must be made available
  within a limited time so that they can be used during the night's
  processing.}

\end{itemize}

This test specification exists to verify these goals.

\subsubsection{Approach refinements}

The general approach defined in \citeds{LDM-503} is used.

\subsubsection{Test case identification}
