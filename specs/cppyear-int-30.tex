\subsection{CPPYEAR-INT-30: Annual Calibration Product Production Integration}
\label{cppyear-int-30}

\subsubsection{Objective}

This test design verifies that the annual calibration products production can
be successfully carried out by the LSST processing control system.

Note that the algorithmic and integration requirements on annual calibration
products update are identical to those on the periodic update, which are
verified in \hyperref[cppslow-int-20][CPPSLOW-INT-20]
(\S\ref{cppslow-int-20}). The substantive difference over earlier
specifications is simply in the volume of data which must be processed.

\subsubsection{Approach refinements}

The general approach defined in \citeds{LDM-503} is used.
