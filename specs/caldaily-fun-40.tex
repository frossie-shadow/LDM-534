\subsection{CALDAILY-FUN-40: Daily Calibration Product Report}
\label{caldaily-fun-40}

\subsubsection{Objective}

This test design verifies that daily calibration product updates can be
produced by the LSST processing control software.

While the algorithmic components of daily calibration product updates are
broadly the same as the periodic and annual updates (and thus are verified by
\hyperref[cppslow-fun-10][CPPSLOW-FUN-10]), daily processing adds some new
constraints. In this test, we verify that, in addition to the calibration
products themselves, a report a report describing differences in the
calibration products from night to night is also generated.

\subsubsection{Approach refinements}

The general approach defined in \citeds{LDM-503} is used.
